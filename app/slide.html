                        <p>There is no agreed legal definition of ‘indigenous people’. However the UN’s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has approved the following description, stating that the UN ‘system’ has developed a modern understanding of this term [indigenous people] based on the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self- identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member.</li>
                            <li>Historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies </li>
                            <li>Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources </li>
                            <li>Distinct social, economic or political systems.</li>
                            <li>Distinct language, culture and beliefs Form non-dominant groups of society</li>
                            <li>Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>According to the UN the most fruitful approach is to identify, rather than define indigenous peoples. This is based on the fundamental criterion of self-identification as underlined in a number of human rights documents. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Factsheet: Who are Indigenous Peoples (Accessed 25 March 2012). The eight groups in the Lower Omo Valley fit this definition and are considered indigenous peoples.</p>
