                            <p>The construction of a diversion dam caught everyone by surprise when it was constructed in May 2012 to divert the waters of the Omo River into the sugar plantation’s irrigation canals. Not built to proper engineering standards the earthen structure broke twice before successfully diverting waters into the irrigation canals. Rising floodwaters behind this dam resulted in the flooding of Bodi farms, huts, and granaries. 220 households were displaced and their sorghum crops <a href="#gallery7" data-overlay="true">lost for the year</a>. Impacts were also felt downstream where water levels dropped dramatically.</p>

                    <div class="columns">
                        <p>There is no agreed legal definition of ‘indigenous people’. However the UN’s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has approved the following description, stating that the UN ‘system’ has developed a modern understanding of this term [indigenous people] based on the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self- identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member.</li>
                            <li>Historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies </li>
                            <li>Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources </li>
                            <li>Distinct social, economic or political systems.</li>
                            <li>Distinct language, culture and beliefs Form non-dominant groups of society</li>
                            <li>Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>According to the UN the most fruitful approach is to identify, rather than define indigenous peoples. This is based on the fundamental criterion of self-identification as underlined in a number of human rights documents. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Factsheet: Who are Indigenous Peoples (Accessed 25 March 2012). The eight groups in the Lower Omo Valley fit this definition and are considered indigenous peoples.</p>

                        <p>Definitions of pastoralism vary widely, but generally all involve the focus on livestock production and some form of mobility. Agro-pastoralism combines elements of pastoralism with sedentary agriculture. Many of the Lower Omo’s indigenous populations practice agro-pastoralism as they grow food along the banks of the Omo River and other fertile locations, in addition to cattle rearing.

                        <p>Africa’s tallest dam has been under construction since 2006 and is scheduled to be in operation by 2013. It will generate 1870MW of much needed power for Ethiopia and neighboring countries, but at a cost to local people. The annual flood of the Omo River, so critical for sorghum production, will be eliminated, and water levels in Kenya’s Lake Turkana could be reduced by as much as 22 meters.  Major International Financial Institutions (World Bank, European Investment Bank, etc) declined to finance the dam. A significant portion of the funding for the $2 billion project comes from the Industrial-commercial Bank of China.</p>

                    <p>“This corporation was established to make Ethiopia one of the major sugar exporters. The plan is to start from scratch because we are building these factories in areas where there is no activity. Those areas are scarcely populated and you don’t have to displace many people. And if you have to displace a few people, you relocate them and you give them irrigated land and infrastructure.” Tsehaye, a former national security adviser, says Sugar Corporation will offer investors a “full package of support, helping them in handling local communities.”</p>

                        <p>The villagization program is part of a nationwide effort to move 1.5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists into permanent villages. Human Rights Watch has documented various abuses related to the villagization program in Gambella region . In Gambella, indigenous populations were being moved into new villages by force. Locations were dry and not suitable for food production and services were not being provided as promised. Those who questioned the program were being arbitrarily detained, threatened, or beaten. Due to the negative impacts of this program, several thousand individuals have fled to neighboring South Sudan and Kenya. See Waiting Here for Death for <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/104284" target="_blank">more information</a> Villagization is also underway in Afar, Somali, and Benishangul-Gumuz regions.</p>

                        <p>The Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program contributes to the salaries of the woreda government employees who are implementing the villagization program. PBS provides services in the areas of education, health care, water, roads and agriculture - the exact five areas of the villagization program. The program pays salaries of teachers, health care extension workers and others who have, in some villages, been asked to mobilize people to move to the new villages. In September 2012 the third round of the PBS program was approved. The major contributors to PBS are the World Bank, DFID, the African Development Bank, and the European Commission.</p>
                        <p>According to the villagization plan for Lower Omo, the Pastoral Development Community Development Project (PCDP) is also expected to fund certain services in the new village. PCDP is funded by the World Bank and the African Development Bank. The third round of financing for PCDP is to be considered by the World Bank in September 2013.</p>

It is not clear what steps have been taken, if any, to substantiate these allegations. No public information has been made available from the second assessment in November 2012.</p>

                    <p>My name is Red Frog. Yesterday I went to the Omo River. I went to go and check on my sorghum storage, to check if it had been eaten by baboons. When I went I saw the roads. The cleared a lot of land. They dug it all. They dug out my cooking fire rocks. They dug up all my sorghum in the grain stores and threw it away. The place where I keep my children they dug it up and threw it away. My land was all dug up and thrown away.  Yesterday evening I came back here with nothing, no grain. My land is gone. The government when it came and threw my grain stores away did it not see them? Does it not have any eyes?</p>

                    <p>They came and just started clearing the forest without talking to us. Why are they clearing the forest? We have never seen anything like this before. We don’t know how it will be. The forest is the forest of ours forever. We the owners cleared small patches and planted. We don’t want the whole forest to be cleared. ‘We’re going to clear it,’ said the government. They came by force. They came with their trucks and ran over some of our people. They are taking our land by force. The bulldozer even cleared the gardens where our crops were growing. They cleared a very straight road to a place called Shigitan. Where they cleared out the cultivation sites we had already planted. Then they went south down the Omo River. They dug some holes and made a village for the road workers.</p>

                    <p>We don’t lie, we tell you the truth. The land is ours. If we wanted it to be cleared, we would agree. But we don’t want that because we don’t want to live in towns and be in towns. The bush is good, we have no poor people, we have many bees, honey, sorghum, so we keep eating. When it is dry season, we can feed leaves to the cattle, and during the rainy season they come back and graze the grass. Many wild animals. We forbid clearing bc we want to keep our wildlife. We are very sad to see the bush disappear. 30 beehives in the big trees, with this honey we can buy cattle. The govt say they will take care of us, but there are many poor people in their towns, how can they take care of us?</p>
